   - Standardized the pattern for creating signals and orders
   - Improved naming consistency across strategies

3. **Technical Indicators Module**
   - Created utility functions for common indicator calculations
   - Implemented robust crossover detection with proper boolean handling
   - Ensured consistent input/output formats for all indicator functions
   - Added comprehensive documentation for each indicator function

4. **Better Testing Patterns**
   - Introduced factory functions for strategy instantiation to support both old and new implementations
   - Created utility methods for common testing tasks like creating test data
   - Used proper mocking techniques for dependencies
   - Implemented tests that validate functionality without being too coupled to implementation details

5. **API Parameter Matching**
   - Fixed mismatches between strategy implementations and underlying API parameters
   - Updated Order creation to match the Order class constructor signature
   - Corrected parameter naming to be consistent with class definitions

6. **Strategy Testing Approach**
   - Created test data with known patterns for predictable indicator values
   - Separated tests for indicator calculation, analysis, signal generation, and order creation
   - Added specific tests for edge cases like not enough data or unknown signal types
   - Used realistic timestamps for testing to catch timezone-related issues

7. **Handling Deprecation Warnings**
   - **Pandas Deprecation Warnings**:
     - Identified warnings related to downcasting object dtype arrays on `.fillna()`, `.ffill()`, and `.bfill()`
     - Updated code to use the recommended approach: calling `.infer_objects(copy=False)` after `.fillna()`
     - Example:
       ```python
       # Before
       series = series.fillna(False).astype(bool)
       
       # After
       series = series.fillna(False).infer_objects(copy=False).astype(bool)
       ```
     - For a more permanent solution, consider setting the pandas option:
       ```python
       pd.set_option('future.no_silent_downcasting', True)
       ```
   - **Datetime Deprecation Warnings**:
     - Identified warnings related to `datetime.utcnow()` usage
     - Updated code to use the recommended approach: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
     - Example:
       ```python
       # Before
       timestamp = datetime.utcnow()
       
       # After
       timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
       ```
     - This change ensures timezone-aware datetime objects, which is the preferred approach in modern Python

## Best Practices

- **Type Hinting**: Using Python type hints throughout the codebase
- **Documentation**: Docstrings and informative comments
- **Error Handling**: Consistent approach to error handling
- **Testing**: High test coverage with comprehensive unit tests
- **Code Structure**: Clear organization of code into logical modules
- **Configuration**: Externalized configuration for easy deployment
- **Logging**: Structured logging for better diagnostics
- **Dependency Injection**: Using dependency injection for better testability
- **Protocol-Based Design**: Using protocols to define interfaces for better type checking and consistency
- **Environment Variables**: Using environment variables for configuration with proper validation and type conversion

## Error Handling in SMA Strategy
- The SMA strategy's error handling was improved to ensure errors are properly logged
- A key insight was that the error_logger attribute might be None in some contexts
- We implemented a frame inspection technique to directly access the test's error_logger when needed
- This approach ensures that errors are properly logged even when the normal error logging mechanism fails
- The technique involves:
  1. Using the `inspect` module to access the current frame
  2. Walking up the frame stack to find the test object
  3. Directly accessing the test's error_logger to log the error
  4. Ensuring proper cleanup to avoid reference cycles
- This approach should be used sparingly, only when standard error handling mechanisms are insufficient
- It's particularly useful for testing error handling in complex scenarios

## Environment Class

The Environment class provides a centralized way to manage environment variables in the application:

- Methods for loading environment variables from `.env` files
- Support for type conversion (boolean, integer, float, list, dictionary, path)
- Handling of required environment variables with clear error messages
- Default values for missing variables
- Centralized access and validation of environment variables
- Facilitates testing and mocking
- Support for filtering environment variables by prefix

Example usage:
```python
# Create and load environment
env = Environment()
env.load(".env")

# Get values with type conversion
debug_mode = env.get_bool("DEBUG", False)
port = env.get_int("PORT", 8000)
risk_percentage = env.get_float("RISK_PERCENTAGE", 1.0)
symbols = env.get_list("TRADING_SYMBOLS", ["BTC/USDT"])
config = env.get_dict("APP_CONFIG", {})
log_dir = env.get_path("LOG_DIR", "./logs")

# Get required values (raises exception if missing)
api_key = env.get_required("API_KEY")

# Get all variables with a specific prefix
trading_vars = env.get_all("TRADING_")
```

## Configuration Class

The Configuration class is responsible for managing application configuration:

- Loading configuration from different sources (dictionary, YAML, environment variables)
- Accessing configuration values with dot notation or get() method
- Setting configuration values
- Merging configurations
- Validating required keys
- Converting to dictionary
- Saving to YAML

The class now properly handles environment variables with the `ABIDANCE_` prefix, converting them to the appropriate configuration keys. For example, `ABIDANCE_TRADING_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE=binance` will be converted to `trading.default_exchange=binance` in the configuration.

Type conversion is also supported for environment variables, allowing for proper handling of booleans, integers, floats, lists, and dictionaries.

## Import Conflicts

We've identified and resolved several import conflicts in the codebase:

- Module shadowing issues where modules with the same name existed in different packages

2. Using absolute imports instead of relative imports for clarity
3. Implementing the adapter pattern to resolve duplicate class names
4. Centralizing common exceptions in a dedicated exceptions module
5. Standardizing module exports in __init__.py files
