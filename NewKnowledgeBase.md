- When validating configurations, check for empty values in required fields, not just their presence.
- For configuration tests, consider creating alternative test implementations when the expected behavior changes.
- Configuration validation should include bounds checking for numerical parameters.

## Code Maintenance and Project Cleanup

- Regular cleanup of temporary scripts and fix files is essential to prevent confusion and maintain a clean codebase
- Temporary fix scripts should be documented with clear comments explaining their purpose and when they can be safely removed
- Symbolic links (like the 'bot' directory pointing to 'Trading_Bot') can create confusing directory structures but may be necessary for compatibility
- Having multiple test files with different naming conventions (test_*, *_fixed.py, *_bva.py) helps during transition periods but can be confusing long-term
- When creating fix scripts, include safeguards and backup functionality to prevent accidental data loss
- Automated tests should be run after cleanup activities to ensure nothing essential was removed
- Periodically audit the project for redundant files, especially after major refactoring or bug fixing cycles
- Test files with alternative implementations (like test_config_fixed.py) should eventually be merged back into the main test files
- Keep a comprehensive changelog that documents cleanup activities to help team members understand what was removed and why
- Document knowledge gained during cleanup in a knowledge base to prevent future accumulation of similar technical debt

## Project Maintenance

- Regularly clean up temporary scripts and utilities once they've served their purpose
- Use tools like `find` to identify potential duplicate or deprecated files
- Keep project structure clean by removing temporary files immediately after their use
- Document the purpose of utility scripts to make it clear when they can be safely removed
- Consider using version control branches for experimental changes rather than creating separate "fix" scripts
- Run tests after cleanup to ensure no dependencies were accidentally removed
- Use symbolic links cautiously as they can create apparent duplication in directory listings
- Monitor test directory structure for potential test file duplication
- Be consistent in test file naming to help identify related tests (e.g., test_*.py, test_*_bva.py, pytest_*.py)
- When fixing tests, integrate the fixes directly rather than creating separate fixed versions
- Maintain a clear distinction between utility scripts (to keep) and temporary fix scripts (to eventually remove)
